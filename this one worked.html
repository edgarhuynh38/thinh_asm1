		<ul>
		<li> Name: Huynh Quoc Thinh (黄国盛）
		<li> Student ID: s3820374
		<li> E-mail: s3820374@rmit.edu.vn
		<li> I was born and raised in Sai Gon, also known as Ho Chi Minh city. I can speak 4 different languages, such as Vietnamese, English, Chinese and Cantonese because my mom is from Taiwan. When I turned 18, my dad decided to send me to United States, and I lived there for 3 years. However, I have to do some paperwork in Vietnam, so that's why I am here.

	<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
		<ul>
		<li> If memory serves, I started to have a huge love in coding on March 2012. At that time, I was 13; I saw my uncle coding on his computer, and I asked him "What are you doing? It looks so great!!!". He said that he is creating a game for VNG company.
		<li> When I came back to Vietnam on June 2019, my dad took me to District 7 to fishing. We went through RMIT, and I saw a building that its designed looks like a "circut". Therefore, an idea was popped up in my mind like "Wow, its designed is so amazing, if I study in this university, I will learn a lot of good things". Well, I think that I made a BEST DECISION in my life.
		<li> I expected that RMIT will teach me how to do coding like my uncle when I graduated.

		<li> Participate in the design, development, testing and documentation for embedded software part of IoT applications, providing consultant technical support for end user. Responsible for software delivery, communicate with leader, project manager or customer.
		<li> The company has 2 type of qualifications (Basic/Preferred). For the basic qualification, the company required a "Have strong C language skills", "Worked in embedded software development with more than 2 years", "Bachelor's degree in Engineering or Computer Science", "Have a strong resource-constrained, real time, embedded environment". However, preferred qualifications are more strictly than basic because they required we need to have experience working with IoT project, and wireless stacks.
		<li> To be honest, this is my first time doing all stuff like this, so currently, I just know some basic skills like working on Python and creating a website. I think I do not have enough abilities to apply to this job.
		<li> First of all, I will work on Python to know more basic skills and learn how to use more "coding-languages" especially C language to fit with company's requirements. Then, I will spend time with my uncle to learn from him, becasue I never heard about "embedded software", so I guess, I really need to focus on it too. That's what I am planning to get into the IT-world.
