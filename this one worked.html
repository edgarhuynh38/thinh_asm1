		<ul>
		<li> Name: Huynh Quoc Thinh (黄国盛)
		<li> Student ID: s3820374
		<li> E-mail: s3820374@rmit.edu.vn
		<li> I was born and raised in Sai Gon, also known as Ho Chi Minh city. I can speak 4 different languages, such as Vietnamese, English, Chinese and Cantonese because my mom is from Taiwan. When I turned 18, my dad decided to send me to United States, and I lived there for 3 years. However, I have to do some paperwork in Vietnam, so that's why I am here.
		</ul>
	<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
		<ul>
		<li> If memory serves, I started to have a huge love in coding on March 2012. At that time, I was 13; I saw my uncle coding on his computer, and I asked him "What are you doing? It looks so great!!!". He said that he is creating a game for VNG company.
		<li> When I came back to Vietnam on June 2019, my dad took me to District 7 to fishing. We went through RMIT, and I saw a building that its designed looks like a "circut". Therefore, an idea was popped up in my mind like "Wow, its designed is so amazing, if I study in this university, I will learn a lot of good things". Well, I think that I made a BEST DECISION in my life.

		<li> I expected that RMIT will teach me how to do coding like my uncle when I graduated.
		</ul>

		<a href itviec.com/it-jobs/embedded-software-engineer-c-language-fpt-software-1100?lab_feature=employer_job> itviec.com/it-jobs/embedded-software-engineer-c-language-fpt-software-1100?lab_feature=employer_job </a>
		<ul>
		<li> Participate in the design, development, testing and documentation for embedded software part of IoT applications, providing consultant technical support for end user. Responsible for software delivery, communicate with leader, project manager or customer.
		<li> The company has 2 type of qualifications (Basic/Preferred). For the basic qualification, the company required a "Have strong C language skills", "Worked in embedded software development with more than 2 years", "Bachelor's degree in Engineering or Computer Science", "Have a strong resource-constrained, real time, embedded environment". However, preferred qualifications are more strictly than basic because they required we need to have experience working with IoT project, and wireless stacks.
		<li> To be honest, this is my first time doing all stuff like this, so currently, I just know some basic skills like working on Python and creating a website. I think I do not have enough abilities to apply to this job.
		<li> First of all, I will work on Python to know more basic skills and learn how to use more "coding-languages" especially C language to fit with company's requirements. Then, I will spend time with my uncle to learn from him, becasue I never heard about "embedded software", so I guess, I really need to focus on it too. That's what I am planning to get into the IT-world.</ul>
<h2> Personal Proflie </h2>
<ul>
<h4> Myers-Briggs Test </h4>
		<li> According to Myers-Briggs test, I am a leader person. It means I have enough abilities to lead a whole group and I can easy to work with people. In my opinion, I think this is true, because I have worked with a lot of people before and we never bumped into any arguments.
<h4> Learning Style Test </h4>
		<li> According to Learning Style test, I am a visual learer. It means I can learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams.
<h4> Creativity Test </h4>
		<li> According to Creativity, I got 63% in total. I got both complexity and paradox are my strongest point. It said I have enough potential to work with statement and able to carry a large quantities of information or manipulate/manage information.
		<p> The results of those tests show that I am a person that everyone will need in their team. Because I can see that, I am type of hard-working, these results just telling the truths. I believe with my characterictics, I will help to boost my teammate's energy to complete the work perfectly. To me, when I forming a team/group, I would like to have a people with fully energy to help teammates achieve their goals and team's Project. Imaging to have a person who always in the bad mood, it will decrease team's performance.  </p>
</ul>
<h2> Project Ideas </h2>
<ul>
	<p> To be honest, when I was young, I always think that I will make something really useful for the world in the future. If memory serves, the first time I worked on some basic codes was 10 years ago. At that time, I was in 6th grade and started learning about Java and I knew what I am going to make when I grow up. I was thinking to create a "tracking device for children". It will be a dot that attached on children's skin or it can be attached on children's accessories. The most important thing is that it can track on "Location, Heartbeat, Emergency". Well, I think this project will be fascinating because it will help parents can take care of their kids when they let them outside. Accoring to the Vietnamese news in 2019, in Japan, there is a Vietnamese kid who was kidnapped by a man that has a mental problem and she was killed by that guy because her parent was not able to take care of her. The main reason why I love to work on this project because I want to protect children in the world. To me, children is like an angle and they deserved to get a protection from their paretns, so I just want to put a small effort to help them. For this part, I show more about the features of this "Tracking device for children". First of all, I will talk about the demension of this device. As I mentioned before, it will be a "dot", that means I will try to make it as invisible as possible, just like a mole. The reason I decided to make it invisible is for safety. If a kid get kidnapped by someone, they are not able to notice that device, so they will not try to take it away. Second, I am thinking about the battery and how to charge. I will try to figure out the way to make the battery approximately 2,600mAh; it is enough to use for one day until we charge the battery again. Moreover, I got an idea to make it like the "Airpod" or "Galaxy Earbuds". For example, if children get in class safety, they can unload the device and put it in "charger-box" to save/charge the battery while they are study. Third, it is 100% water proof. For example, I called it as a "device", but it will become "meanless" if I do not add the water proof to my this device. Imaging a rainny day, your child goes home and the device broken because of the rain, that is not worth, so I think water proof is a must for this project. Fourth, I think this reason is crutial, the device can track the location so it will have a GPS. Nowadays, GPS is a useful tool to help people find a way. Therefore, I will add this to the device so that parents can track where is your children. Furthermore, it also has the "radius-feature", that means, If your children go out of the radius, the device will send the information to your smart phone; it also means that paraents can setting the radius that they want. Last but not least, it can track the children's heartbeat. If children is doing some physical activities, the device will recognize it; but if the device detects something is not normal like physical activities, it will immediately send a SOS signal to their parents through the smartphone with the location. For example, if children bump into a kidnapper, it is 100% that children's heartbeat will increase immediately. Moreover, this device also send every information to partents, so they can track. However, the hardest thing in this project is the software and hardware. As I said above, GPS will be in this device and connect through smartphone that can access to the Internet to track. However, I will try to make this can be use offline, and it will included the infrared to measure the heartbeat. Moreover, I do need more equipments to make this such as, a big place to put a lot of computers in there; and the missions of those computers are keep updating if bugs occur. In addition, there are some specific skills that I need to make this project come true. First of all, I need learn all coding languages, but I think will focus on C language to create an app. Then, I need to learn how to add the "GPS" to my device, and that is what I always concerned about. Next, I do need computers to keep updating and fixing the error of the app (if it has). I believe I can find skills by asking my uncle because he is an expert, or I will ask my professor at my IT class to find the way. Therefore, I think this is totally possible to do. As far as I can predict, if this project successful, it will make a huge change to the world. For example, there are no criminals who targeted to kidnap children or sexual harassment. The percentage of criminals will be sharply decreased. Nowadays, there are some parents afraid to let their kids playing out because of those reasons, so if this project successful, they can let children go outside and play and make friends with others.
